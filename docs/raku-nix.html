    <!-- %title Building Raku modules with Nix -->
<!-- %date 2020, April 3rd -->

<p>
    In this blog post I would like to discuss my findings about building Raku
        modules with Nix, including community modules, and the infrastructure
        that is now partially in place.

<p>
    This all began with the desire to use the Raku programming language in a
        project that was already using the Nix package manager.
    Nix makes it easy to build and deploy software, by using a robust strategy
        for managing dependencies based on sandboxing and cryptographic hashes.
    The existing package management infrastructure for Raku relies on a more
        traditional approach based on imperative installation commands.
    I will not go into the pros and cons of each solution, but will instead
        focus on how I got it all working with Nix.

<h2>Writing raku-nix</h2>

<p>
    The first step down the rabbit hole is
        <a href="https://github.com/chloekek/raku-nix">raku-nix</a>, a bunch of
        Nix code for building Raku modules.

<p>
    There are two steps to building a Raku module: invoke Build.pm if it
        exists, and precompile the distribution into a repository.
    A distribution is a collection of source files and resources along with a
        <abbr>META6</abbr>.json file.
    A repository is a collection of precompiled distributions.
    With the traditional approach, you usually have one repository in your home
        directory, but because of how Nix isolates packages I go with creating
        one repository for each distribution.

<p>
    These two steps now have to be implemented in a combination of Nix and
        Bash.
    Both steps are easy at the surface, but setting up the
        <abbr>PERL6LIB</abbr> environment variable so that the module can find
        its dependencies is rather tricky.
    The <abbr>PERL6LIB</abbr> environment variable must contain one entry for
        each repository, and modules are looked up in these repositories in
        the order given.
    It appears that the first entry in the <abbr>PERL6LIB</abbr> environment
        variable <em>has to be</em> the module itself, otherwise you would get
        obscure error messages.

<p>
    With all that out of the way, I have now written the
        <a href="https://github.com/chloekek/raku-nix/blob/master/tools/rakuPackage.nix">rakuPackage</a>
        function, whose invocation looks like this:

<pre>rakuPackage {
    name = "LibCurl";
    depends = [ rakuPackages."JSON-Fast" ];
    buildDepends = [ ];
    nativeDepends = [ curl ];
    src = fetchurl {
        url = "https://www.cpan.org/authors/id/C/CT/CTILMES/Perl6/LibCurl-0.9.tar.gz";
        sha256 = "937508b3646a8db98d74e624c78b27a3f729c4cf9a83414d2447e535be152d9e";
    };
}</pre>

<p>
    Note that Nix requires you to put a hash of the tarball in the package
        description.
    This ensures that your build will give the same output no matter where or
        when you run it.
    Of course, looking up all of these hashes by hand is a tremendously boring
        and tedious task, especially when using modules that have lots of
        transitive dependencies.
    So we tumble deeper down the rabbit hole …

<h2>Developing <abbr>CRAI</abbr></h2>

<p>
    To automate finding archives (tarballs) and hashes I developed
        <a href="https://crai.foldr.nl"><abbr>CRAI</abbr></a>.
    Every hour, <abbr>CRAI</abbr> finds a list of all Raku modules on
        <abbr>CPAN</abbr> and GitHub and computes hashes of new versions.
    You can search this database using the web interface, or download it
        directly.
    Please note that the web interface is far from finished.

<p>
    Finding archives on <abbr>CPAN</abbr> is trivial, with rsync.
    It is by far the easiest part of this whole expedition.
    Finding archives of modules hosted on GitHub, however, is not as easy.
    It took me weeks to figure out how to do this, but I think I found an
        acceptable solution:

<ul>
    <li>
        The starting point is the file at
            <code>https://ecosystem-api.p6c.org/projects.json</code>, which
            contains an index of all <abbr>META6</abbr>.json files of
            GitHub-hosted Raku modules.
        Each entry in this file only points to a GitHub repository, so to find
            the archive URLs we need to do a little more work.
        I have no idea who maintains this endpoint, but kudos to them, as it is
            incredibly helpful!
    <li>
        If people use Git tags to highlight their releases, then simply listing
            the tags and creating a GitHub archive URL for each does the trick.
    <li>
        If not, then there is nothing we can do but to create an archive for
            the <abbr>HEAD</abbr> commit.
        New versions will pour in because <abbr>CRAI</abbr> re-indexes these
            hourly, but if <abbr>HEAD</abbr> does not change the version
            number in <abbr>META6</abbr>.json then you will simply end up
            with multiple archives that use the same version number but have
            different hashes.
        C’est la vie.
</ul>

<h2>Back to raku-nix</h2>

<p>
    Now that <abbr>CRAI</abbr> was in place, I could write
        <a href="https://github.com/chloekek/raku-nix/blob/master/tools/generate-nix.pl">a script</a>
        to download the database and generate a Nix package description for
        each latest version of each Raku community module.
    These are now all available in the raku-nix GitHub repository.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>
    If you like Nix and Raku I hope you found this blog post interesting.
    If you decide to use raku-nix please let me know what you think and how it
        can be improved.
